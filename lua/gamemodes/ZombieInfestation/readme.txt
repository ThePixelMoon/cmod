-- Zombie Infestation
-- Created by g33k (mattmullins@gmail.com)
-- Version 1.1
--
-- Try to be the last to survive. If a zombie kills you then you respawn as a zombie.
-- The zombies health is dynamic. If you start out as a zombie you will have alot more
-- health to compinsate for the lack of teamates. The more humans that turn into zombies
-- the less health zombies get.
