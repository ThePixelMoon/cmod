-- Try to be the last to survive. If a zombie kills you then you respawn as a zombie.
-- The zombies health is dynamic. If you start out as a zombie you will have alot more
-- health to compinsate for the lack of teamates. The more humans that turn into zombies
-- the less health zombies get.
--

-- Add other models as you please. Just make sure each one has a comma after it except the last one

-- This is used to multipy the zombie's health. It multiplys by how many humans there are
