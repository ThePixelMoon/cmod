This 'cheat sheet' is aimed at people that have a basic knowledge of programming. I'll start with some quick and obvious things that people may or may not know.

<ul>
<li> The .lua files are plain text. Open them with a text editor (like Notepad).
<li> If you open in notepad and all of the text is on one line then use an editor like <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> or <a href="http://blua.sourceforge.net/">BLua</a>.
<li> All functions which call functions in the Source Engine start with the _ character.
<li> You don't have to add a ; at the end of every line - put it won't punish you for adding it.
</ul>

As for the style of Lua.. Here's some common code to learn from.

<ul>
<li> <strong>Defining a function</strong>
<p><pre>
function SayMyName( name )

     Msg( "Your Name Is " .. name )

end
</pre></p>

<li> <strong>Calling a function</strong>
<p><pre>
SayMyName( "garry" );
</pre></p>

<li> <strong>Commenting</strong>
<p><pre>
-- Calling the function boss.
SayMyName( "garry" );
-- Called the function boss.
</pre></p>

<li> <strong>If statement</strong>
<p><pre>

if ( name == "garry" ) then

     SayMyName( "garry" )

end


if ( name ~= "garry" ) then

     SayMyName( "NOT garry" )

end
</pre></p>




<li> <strong>For statement</strong>
<p><pre>
-- Loops i from 0 to 32
for i=0, 32 do

    Msg( "Number " .. i )

end
</pre></p>


<li> <strong>Variables</strong>
<p><pre>

-- Locals only exist within the function in which they're defined
-- If you don't declare a variable as local it will exist globally by default

local name = "garry"


-- Tables are like arrays, they must be declared like so

PlayerNames = {}


-- and then you can fill them up like so

PlayerNames[0] = "david"
PlayerNames[1] = "andrew"

Msg( "Player 0's name is " .. PlayerNames[0] )


-- The index doesn't have to be a number

PlayerNames["test"] = "superdood";

Msg( "Player's name is " .. PlayerNames["test"] )
-- or
Msg( "Player's name is " .. PlayerNames.test )


-- Variables aren't a set type and can hold anything

Players = {}

Players[0] = {}
Players[0].name = "Garry"
Players[0].money = 1000
Players[0].age = 32


-- They can even hold functions since they're a legitimate variable type

function SayHello( )

     Msg ( "Hello" )

end

Players[0].intro = SayHello

Players[0].intro()


-- which means you can also pass them to functions

function SayPlayerHello ( in_function )

     in_function()

end

SayPlayerHello( Players[0].intro )

</pre></p>

</ul>

I probably went a bit complicated towards the end for the new guys. 
I just want to give you an idea of what to expect when you're looking at other people's code.
I know what it's like to have big blanks in your programming knowledge.

Anyway, here's some useful Lua links:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua's Homepage</a> - not too useful, but you might want to visit.
<li> <a href="http://gmwiki.garry.tv/index.php/Lua">GMod Wiki</a> - the Lua scripting section in the Garry's Mod Wiki.
<li> <a href="http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/forumdisplay.php?f=49">GMod Lua Forum</a> - ask for help, give help, share your mods!
